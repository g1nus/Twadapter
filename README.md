# Twadapter

This express app will connect to an external API documented [here]() in order to process its data and make it more *"JSON friendly"*. 

## Installation and setup

First of all clone the repo and then run: ```npm install```

Then you must set up the ENV variables (you can take a look at an example [here](https://github.com/g1nus/Twadapter/blob/main/.env.example)).

Finally, you can run the app by running: ```npm start```

## Api Documentation

You can find the full API documentation [here](https://epsilonmanoglytica.docs.apiary.io/).
